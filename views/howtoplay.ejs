					<article> Once a user has registered, they will wait until all players are gather for the game to start. Once the game starts players will be broke up into groups. The group will have leader [KING], who will choose the best card for the category. The other players in the group [PAWNS], will be given [number of cards], and will select the appropriate card for the category within [30 seconds].
